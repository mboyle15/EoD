The Project is: 
Engineering on display.
A display for monitors in the EIB building. 
Delivery Date: 05/06/2017 
Service Compensation: $0.00 USD

Project Description: 
A display for monitors in the EIB building, showing reading from sensors within the building and information or advertisements posted by members of staff.



       e. Key Assumptions: 
Dr. Mock is responsible for setting up access to the Siemens data to be used in the application.  If data for the EIB is not provided, then data from another building will be provided.
Dr. Mock or IT Services will provide access to a MS SQL database for storing a local copy of the database.  
Dr. Mock or IT Services will provide an ASP.Net webserver.
Dr. Mock will provide the three touchscreen displays currently mounted in the EIB building to run the capstone software.  
Advertising powerpoint slides will be provided and updated by Dr. Mock and building staff.  
	
Scope of Services List
		i. The program will show advertisements as provided by members of staff.
ii. The program will show graphs detailing the energy data received.
iii. Allow access for information, advertisements and data, to be updated by members of staff.
iv. Disallow entry to the system by any whose purpose is not to update data or maintain program.
v. Provide metrics of usage.

Project Requirements



Functional Requirements
Web Application
The primary purpose is to create a website to display energy data for the EIB build. The title of the project, energy on display, will hereafter be referred to as EoD.

Statistics Function
This is the primary function of the EoD webapp. It will display the building data in graphical and informative ways, and also allow for the manipulations of parameters to view the data in different contexts, such as over periods of time and averages.
	
	Below is a list of buttons on the interface for the statistics function.

Air temperature graph
Air temperature <Button>  Switches the graph to display air temperature selected time scale.
Celsius <Button> changes the temperature measure to degrees Celsius.  Then gray out the button so it can’t be click twice.
Fahrenheit <Button> changes the temperature measure to degrees Fahrenheit.  Then gray out the button so it can’t be click twice.
Water usage graph
Water usage <Button> changes the graph to display water usage verses selected time scale. 
Energy usage graph
Energy usage <button> changes the graph to display energy usage versus selected time scale.  
kW <button> changes the graph energy measure to kW.
kWh <button> changes the graph energy measure to kWh.
Gas usage graph
Gas usage <button> changes the graph to display gas usage versus selected timescale. 
Time scales 
Time scales group of buttons, if a button it is pressed, it will be disabled and change scale. The previous scale button will be enabled.    
Day <button> changes the time scale to current day.
Week <button> changes the time scale to the current week.
Month <button> changes the time scale to the current month.
Year <button> changes the time scale to the current year.
Custom <button> changes the interface to add date select boxes for start and end time periods.
Start <datebox> is where user can select a custom start date.
End <datebox> is where user can select a custom end date.  
Graph types
Graph types group of buttons will select what type of graph to be displayed. 
Bar <button> changes the graph to a bar graph. The time increments will depend on the timescale selected.  Normally the lower scale will be used.   Example: if week is selected then increments will be in day.  
Line <button> changes the graph to a line graph.  

Advertisements
The advertisements are the secondary function of the EoD webapp. They will be images provided by members of staff to be displayed on the monitors. They will be shown through a slideshow within a passive display, which will cycle through the current selection provided. 

Power User
Attach a keyboard and login to website as a power user. 
Open and close the website.  
Add or delete slides from the advertising.  
Request metrics on how many people touch display, what are they looking at, high traffic times, etc.  


Non-functional Requirements
Concurrent Users:  Minimum of three concurrent users corresponding to the three displays in the EIB. 
Statistics will be updated every 15 minutes if data is provided by Siemens.   
After 15 minutes of inactivity the active display of statistics will revert to a passive display of advertisements.  

Crash / Error Handling
In the event the web browser or the computer crashes.  The software will be restarted.  No saving of states, or recovery needed.  
If database is not available the website will continue to show advertising with a small text prompt saying the server is unavailable.  An email message will be sent to the designated maintenance person for resolution.  

Assumptions
Database and interface development will be modeled off the preexisting data until current data for the EIB has been obtained from Siemens.  
Implementation will start once a MS SQL database and ASP.Net servers are setup by IT Services.  
Final testing and deployment of software will require access to the three touchscreen displays at the EIB.
